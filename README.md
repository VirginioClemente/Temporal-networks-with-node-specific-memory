# MaxEnt-For-Temporal-Networks

This repository contains the code for the implementation of the study conducted in the following works: [1] and [2].
The first study concerns the definition of a maximum entropy model with temporal constraints. For further information regarding the model, please refer to the paper [1].
We have implemented various types of models, varying the degree of heterogeneity of the constraints. For each of these models, a Python class has been created. The 'experiments' notebook contains the results of applying these models to a real network.

The data related to the application on the real world example [3] of the first paper, are available upon request at the following link: http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/realitymining4.html.

The second study is related to the usage of the model developed in [1] to improve the commonity detection tast in time evolving networks. 
The data used for the real world application of this second paper are related to the following work: [4].

The algorithm implemented is a modified verison of [5].
