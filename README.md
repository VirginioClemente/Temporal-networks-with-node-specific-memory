# MaxEnt-For-Temporal-Networks

This repository contains the code for the implementation of the study conducted in the following work: ...
The study concerns the definition of a maximum entropy model with temporal constraints. For further information regarding the model, please refer to the paper:
We have implemented various types of models, varying the degree of heterogeneity of the constraints. For each of these models, a Python class has been created. The 'experiments' notebook contains the results of applying these models to a real network.
