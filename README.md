# MaxEnt-For-Temporal-Networks

### This repository is under construction.

This repository contains the code for the implementation of the study conducted in [1].
This study concerns the definition of a maximum entropy model with temporal constraints. For further information regarding the model, please refer to the paper [1].
We have implemented various types of models, varying the degree of heterogeneity of the constraints. For each of these models, a Python class has been created. The 'experiments' notebook contains the results of applying these models to a real network.

The data related to the application on the real world example of the first paper, are available upon request at the following link: http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/realitymining4.html.
